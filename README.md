# IGS GNSS data extraction with Python
This repository contains scripts which extracts GNSS data from IGS stations using an extraction algorithm which extracts the values and saves them to csv files.
The repository does not contain the datasets used.

The processed GNSS file for 41 stations were stored in a folder called```CORS_stations``` inside the root directory.
Each of the 41 stations had folders for the month of MAY through to DECEMBER.
Each of the months had folders for the number of days in the months.
The day folders contained the processed GNSS file.

Refer to ```README.txt``` for detailed instructions on how to perform a successful extraction.
